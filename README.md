The main script used in the analysis is in R/modelli_1_bis.R.
It loads data/data_1.RData where some preprocessing has already been made by the R/preprocessing_1.R.
It also loads the subsampling indexes file data/gufi_ids_exclude.txt made by the script R/gufi_subsample.R.

In the R/modelli_1_bis.R script you can choose to load the alla the object of the analysis from results/outpust/final_work_space.RData, in some sections running the script will overwrite the RData.
